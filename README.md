# Capistrano::Generals

Capistrano tasks that are used quite often.
Push your code to git, upload stage specific config files.

## Installation

Add this to your application's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
group :development do
  gem 'capistrano'
  gem 'capistrano-generals'
end
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

And add this to the `Capfile`:

```ruby
require 'capistrano/generals'
```

## Usage
When the generals package is added to the `Capfile`, the user can specify the required tasks.
In your `config/deploy.rb` you can add the taks by adding them to the deploy namespace like this:

```ruby
namespace :deploy do
  before :deploy,   'git:push'
  before :deploy,   'deploy:symlink:upload_linked_files'
  after  :deploy,   'setup:symlink:unicorn'
  after  :deploy,   'setup:symlink:nginx'
  after  :deploy,   'setup:symlink:sidekiq'
  after  :deploy,   'unicorn:restart'
  after  :rollback, 'unicorn:restart'
  after  :deploy,   'nginx:restart'
  after  :rollback, 'nginx:restart'
  after  :deploy,   'sidekiq:restart'
  after  :rollback, 'sidekiq:restart'
end
```

### Setup linked files
There are some tasks for linking configuration files to the system. It is
possible to use stage specific files like `config/nginx.staging.conf`. It will
then link this file to the system. If the stage specific file is not present,
it will look for the `config/nginx.conf` file. If that is absent as well it will
raise an error.
```ruby
cap <stage> setup:symlink:nginx    # Adds config/nginx.stage.conf to enabled nginx sites
cap <stage> setup:symlink:unicorn  # Adds config/unicorn_init.stage.sh to /etc/init.d scripts and add run at startup
cap <stage> setup:symlink:sidekiq  # Adds config/sidekiq_init.stag.sh to /etc/init.d scipts and add run at startup
```

### Git push
This first checks if there are no local changes that has not been committed.
If all changes are committed, they are pushed.

Options:

* IGNORE_DEPLOY_RB=true: This ignores changes in deploy.rb, for testing only!
* FORCE=true: Force push changes

### Upload linked files
This uploads the linked files. It first checks for a stage specific file so for
example you want to upload `database.yml` to the `staging` environment,
the system first searches for `database.staging.yml` and if it cannot find that
it will fall back to the original.

### Restart
This will upgrade the unicorn workers and restart nginx.
